-- DecisionOS — optional photo attachment for posts
--
-- One optional image per post. Storage path convention:
--   <author_id>/<random-filename>.<ext>
-- storage.foldername(name)[1] is the author_id -- policies check that
-- against auth.uid(), the same shape 0005_storage.sql uses for the
-- org-folder check, but keyed to the uploading user directly since posts
-- aren't org-scoped.
