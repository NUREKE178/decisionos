-- DecisionOS — Row Level Security
--
-- Model:
--   * Every org-owned table is readable by any member of that org, writable
--     only by owner/admin/researcher (viewer is read-only).
--   * organizations/organization_members have their own narrower policies.
--   * Anonymous (anon) participants get NO direct table/view access at all --
--     no SELECT, no INSERT, nothing. A policy like "anon can read published
--     experiments" sounds scoped, but RLS policies for the same command
--     OR-combine across every matching policy on a table regardless of which
--     one you were "thinking about", and a plain SELECT policy with no
--     `to <role>` applies to anon AND authenticated alike -- so a looser
--     anon policy silently widens what every signed-in researcher can see
--     too (which is exactly the cross-tenant leak an earlier draft of this
--     migration had, caught in local testing). It also lets anyone enumerate
--     every org's published experiment names by querying without a slug
--     filter. Simplest correct answer: anon gets nothing here. Every public
--     participant interaction (look up an experiment by slug, fetch its
--     variants/questions, start a session, submit a response) goes through
--     Edge Functions running with the service role (see supabase/functions),
--     which bypasses RLS and does its own validation -- published status,
--     slug-scoped lookups only, duplicate prevention, etc.
