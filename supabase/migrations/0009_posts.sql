-- DecisionOS — marketing social layer, slice 1: posts + feed
--
-- Posts are platform-wide (reference profiles directly, no organization_id)
-- -- this is deliberately a cross-org "social feed for marketing
-- professionals" layer, additive alongside the org-scoped research product,
-- not a replacement for it or scoped to any one organization.
--
-- author_id defaults to auth.uid() and is never sent by the client, per the
-- lesson in 0004_server_derived_ownership.sql: a client-supplied value that
-- merely matches auth.uid() at write time is one more thing that can go
-- stale between read and write, while a server-side default can't.
