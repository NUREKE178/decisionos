-- ============================================================================
-- DecisionOS — Storage bucket for variant assets (images/video)
--
-- Public read (stimuli must be viewable by anonymous participants on the
-- public link), writes restricted to org members who can manage the org
-- that owns the file. Path convention is load-bearing:
--   <organization_id>/<experiment_id>/<random-filename>.<ext>
-- storage.foldername(name) splits the object key on "/", so element [1] is
-- the organization_id -- that's what the policy checks against
-- can_manage_org(), the same helper every other write policy uses.
